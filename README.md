# refactor-seo-id

## Description

The motivation for this project was to help this SEO company refactor their code and help them organize/minimize their files to help the webpage to run smoother. Throughout the refactoring process my element tags were switched to better structure the file, along with ids, classes and other elements were deleted because they were simply redundant.
